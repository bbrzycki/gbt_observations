# gbt_observations
Scripts and catalogs for GBT observing. A copy of this repo lives on `/users/bbrzycki/gbt_observations` on `prospero`.

For preparing probe observations, generate ephemerides in JPL Horizons and then convert them to astrid catalogs with `jpl2astrid` script on GBT `prospero` (in ~/observations/probes). Make sure to link to appropriate catalogs / epheremides in observing scripts.
